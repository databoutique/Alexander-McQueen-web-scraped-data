Web scraped data plays a key role in providing insights into the buyers behaviour, preferences, and trends for Alexander McQueen. It helps the brand to strategically price their products and determine discounts based on competitor pricing, popular items, and seasonal trends. For instance, if the data reveals that a competitor is offering similar designs at lower prices, McQueen can adjust their prices or offer special discounts to maintain their sales and market share. Similarly, identifying the bestselling items can assist in designing future collections and allocating marketing resources. On the other hand, during the sale season, scraping data can bring out the most discounted products and the fluctuations in rates, allowing the brand to maintain a profitable margin while remaining competitive.
